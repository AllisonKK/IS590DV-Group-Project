# How to work on this project

- Clone it to your local

```git clone https://github.com/thitta/IS590DV-Group-Project```

- Install the Dependencies 

To avoid version conflict issues, it's recommended to create a new Python virtual env and install the designated versions of dependencies listed in the `requirements.txt` file.

If you are using pip, you can execute: 

```pip install -r <path/to/the/> requirements.txt```

- Work on it and PUSH back

  - **(Optional / Recommended)** CHECKOUT a branch (based on the first commit of the master branch), local COMMIT on your branch, and PUSH your branch to the origin when you finish your part. The branch name can be your name.
  
  - **(Work Around)** You can directly send your file to our slack channel. I will handle the merge manually.
